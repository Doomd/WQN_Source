## To Clone this Repo and make a new Website based on this template:
1. Navigate to a local folder on your computer, open a terminal window and use the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Doomd/WQN_Source2.git nameoffolderyouwant
    ```
 2. To download and initiate all the node_module dependancies for this React project, from the new project root folder you just cloned into, issue this command:
    ```
    yarn
    ```
3. To see your project files in action in a browser, issue this command:
    ```
    yarn start
    ```
4. To create a publishable version of your site that you can host on static web hosts (like github pages) for free, issue this command:
    ```
    yarn build
    ```
    This will create a folder in your root directory called `public` and this folder can/will act as the public folder for your public facing files. This command doesn't yet deploy those files...it only creates the files.
